## Topic Modelling in Python: World War I Letters 

**The Assignment**

This weeks assignment involved training an LDA model on data selected by onself. The purpose was to extract structured information which could provide insight into the data. This would centre around topic modelling and could look at things such as whether authors would cluster together or how concepts would change over time. 

__The Data__ 
I seleted a dataset of 50 handwritten letters between British or French soldiers and their loved ones during the First World War. I was interested to see what topics would arise throughout these letters, written during one of the most distressing times of their lives. This data is saved in the directory above as WW1_Letters.csv and can also be found in the data folder at the root of the directory. 

20 of the letters have been converted from French to English with the use of Google translate.
